## Project Overview

**Software Testing Model** is Ideated to be an addition to OpenLedger's upcoming models that leverages **Specialized Language Models (SLM)** trained on the open-source **UniTSyn** dataset to generate high-quality unit tests automatically. By integrating with a developer-friendly drag-and-drop workflow tester - **playground.ai** over blockchain to be hosted on Openledger Testnet, it provides developers with an intuitive interface to enhance, test and build their software testing workflows and so much more.

## Problem Statement

While Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have shown remarkable capabilities in generating code, their effectiveness in producing accurate and comprehensive unit tests remains limited. Existing LLMs often struggle with generating tests that are both precise and complete because they lack targeted training on test-specific code snippets.

---

## The Solution

### Specialized Language Models (SLM)

It utilize **Specialized Language Models (SLM)** fine-tuned specifically for unit test generation. These models are trained to understand the nuances of software testing, enabling them to produce tests that accurately reflect the intended functionality and edge cases of the code under test.

### Data Source: UniTSyn

**UniTSyn** is a large-scale, open-sThece dataset designed to enhance the capabilities of language models in unit test synthesis. It comprises 2.7 million focal-test pairs across five mainstream programming languages. By associating tests with their corresponding functions, UniTSyn provides the critical context needed for SLMs to infer expected behaviors and verify logical paths effectively.

**Key Features of UniTSyn:**

- **High Volume**: 2.7 million focal-test pairs.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Covers five mainstream programming languages.
- **Contextual Pairing**: Associates each test with its corresponding function for better understanding.
- **Open-SThece Repository**: Access the dataset and contribute via The [GitHub repository](https://github.com/SecurityLab-UCD/UniTSyn).

For an in-depth understanding, refer to The research paper: [Automated Unit Test Generation with UniTSyn](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03396).

### Integration with Playground.ai

By integrating The SLM trained on UniTSyn with **playground.ai**, It offer developers a seamless and interactive environment to generate unit tests effortlessly. Users can input function descriptions or code snippets, and the integrated system will produce relevant and comprehensive unit tests, enhancing the overall development and testing workflow.

## How It Works

1. **Data Preparation**: UniTSyn collects focal-test pairs by leveraging the Language Server Protocol, ensuring accurate associations between functions and their tests without the need for per-project execution setups or language-specific heuristics.

2. **Model Training**: The SLM is fine-tuned on the UniTSyn dataset, enabling it to understand the intricacies of unit testing across different programming languages.

3. **Integration with Playground.ai**:
   - **User Input**: Developers provide function descriptions or code snippets via playground.ai’s intuitive UI.
   - **Test Generation**: The integrated SLM processes the input and generates corresponding unit tests.
   - **Output**: Generated tests are displayed within playground.ai, allowing for easy review and integration into the codebase.

4. **Continuous Improvement**: Feedback from generated tests is used to further refine the SLM, ensuring ongoing enhancements in test accuracy and coverage.
